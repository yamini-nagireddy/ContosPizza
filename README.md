# ASP.NET Core Web API CRUD Operations

This project is a simple RESTful service built using ASP.NET Core that supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for managing products.


## Features
Create Product: Add new product to the database. \
Read All Products: Retrieve a list of all products stored. \
Read Single Product: Fetch details of a specific product by its ID. \
Update Product: Modify existing product information. \
Delete Product: Remove a product. \


## Technologies Used
ASP.NET Core \
C# \
RESTful API principles \


## Note:
For simplicity, an in-memory database is used to store product information. This means that any data added or modified will only persist for the duration of the application's runtime. In a production environment, replace this with a persistent data store such as a SQL database.
